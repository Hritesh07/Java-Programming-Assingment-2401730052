# Java-Programming-Assingment

# 📝 Java Assignments Repository

This repository contains my **Java programming assignments** submitted as part of the course **Fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (Java)** at K.R. Mangalam University.  

Each assignment demonstrates the use of **core Java concepts** including:
- Data types and operators  
- Control structures (loops, conditionals)
